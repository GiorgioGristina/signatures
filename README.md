<h2>Reflection</h2>
Building this web application with the team has been pretty challenging but very rewarding. We were great at communicate and help each other to get this product finished on time. We all have been humble and when we were stuck we were there to back each one of us up. 
This project helped us to apply all the knowledge acquire during the bootcamp and learn how to use the documentation to use new GEM.
The ability to
Definetly there are a lot of parts that could be done better for example the same contract can be signed by multiple person and each user can either send a contract or sign it (at the moment if you are a company you can only send a contract and if you are an individual you can only sign the contract).

<h2>Thank You</h2>
I want to thanks my team for all the support and the great team work that we have done.
